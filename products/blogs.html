                So i decided to write a simple-demo-noob-blog cause, i dont know. First of all its sad that i saved no screenshots of my Webpage 
                progressing it would be cool to see what actualy happend to the webpage. But now i have to decide to rebuild the whole webpage 
                and give it a cleaner look. In my opinion it turns out very well. That Picture you see it is one of the first trys i had. 
                I think you see the difference to now. I will continue to build and expand the webpage.

                I learned a lot the last weeks about programming. Few C# stuff, Html, CSS and some Unity stuff. 
                I will continue and learn more and more and maybe someday the game will be finished or in a Demo state so you can play it if you want.
                I will continue the C# course it helps me a lot in the development process of my game and maybe i will check out the course for 
                GameDevelopment at Wifi to even go further beyond ^^. 
                I think i sayed enough today we will hear/read a other day. Bye! (dont check grammar and misspellings ;))
